# Liri-Node-App
This a language interpretation and recognition interface app in node. 
To use this application, simply open your terminal, navigate to this file's directory, and type into the command line one of four things: 

1) node liri.js spotify-this-song
2) node liri.js movie-this
3) node liri.js my-tweets
4) node liri.js do-what-it-says

Please note that after the commands "spotify-this-song" and "movie-this", the user may type a song name or a movie name, respectively. 

The first command will retrieve a song's name, artist, album, and preview link. 

The second command will retrieve a movie's title, release date, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating, the country in which the movie was produced, the language in which the movie was filmed, the movie's plot, and the movie's cast list.

The third command will return a list of the user's most recent 20 tweets on Twitter, including the tweet's text and the time at which it was posted. 

The fourth command will read what is written in the text file random.txt (on the same level as this directory), and call a command written inside of it. 

Please enjoy retrieving a plethora of data using LIRI!
